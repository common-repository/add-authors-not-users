"Add Authors Not Users" adds author names to posts and pages without adding them as authors or users on the site.

== Description ==


With "Add Authors Not Users" users can add guest author names to posts and pages, without the obligation to add them as registered users.

While guest posting is a very common practice , Wordpress configuration is such as adding guest post authors’ name can be time consuming and burdensome. 

Users have to add the guest author as a user first, which includes adding his email, making sure he or she has the right permissions and only then it is possible to define the user as the author of the post or article. In short, registering users can be time consuming especially if you have many guest posts.
